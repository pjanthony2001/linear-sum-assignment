# linear-sum-assignment


## About the Project

This project helps to solve an assignment problem that matches `n` people to `m` different classes, each class with their own number of places, given the rankings for the classes.

## Getting Started

The input to the program is just a single CSV file, where each row represents a ranking for the different classes by a person. The output will be a CSV file with the assignments of rows to classes. You would need to configure the following constants in the `linear-sum-assignment.py` file:
    - The number of places for each class
    - The weighting function for each ranking
